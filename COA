Computer Organization and Architecture is the study of internal working, structuring, and implementation of a computer system. Architecture in the computer system, 
same as anywhere else, refers to the externally visual attributes of the system. 
Externally visual attributes, here in computer science, mean the way a system is visible to the logic of programs (not the human eyes!). 

Organization of a computer system is the way of practical implementation that results in the realization of architectural specifications of a computer system.
In more general language, the Architecture of a computer system can be considered as a catalog of tools available for any operator using the system,
while Organization will be the way the system is structured so that all those cataloged tools can be used, and efficiently.
